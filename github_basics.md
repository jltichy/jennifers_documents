When creating a repository in GitHub, it suggests that you have the following three documents:

1. README.md -- a .md file is a markdown file, which is a text based file.  This page gives formatting options: https://help.github.com/articles/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax/

2. LICENSE.md -- another markdown file to include if the program will be shared or outsourced

3. .gitignore  -- this is a file that Git uses to determine which files and directories to ignore, before you make a commit.  A .gitignore file should be committed into your repository, in order to share the ignore rules with any other users that clone the repository.
